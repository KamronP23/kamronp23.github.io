          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I’m Kamron Poosti, a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist with
            over 10 years of experience working in the mental health field.
            Having spent most of my life in Los Angeles, I work with adults
            navigating anxiety, depression, loneliness, relationship challenges,
            dating, and career transitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            My style is collaborative, practical, and grounded in real life. I
            aim to create a space that feels supportive, approachable, and
            honest — where you don’t have to overthink what to say or how to
            show up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of therapy, I enjoy video games, pop culture, and building
            things. I have a background in software development and I’m
            currently in the process of building a company, which gives me a
            unique perspective on work stress, burnout, identity, and navigating
            change.
          </p>
          <p>
            I often use shared interests as a way to connect and make therapy
            feel more natural and less intimidating — but I’m just as
            comfortable meeting you wherever you’re at, whether you’re into the
            same things or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            I consider myself personable and lighthearted, and I believe therapy
            can be both meaningful and human. My goal is to help you better
            understand yourself, build practical tools, and move toward a life
            that feels more aligned and fulfilling.

          <h2>My Approach</h2>
          <p>
            Therapy is a space to slow down, gain clarity, and work toward
            meaningful change. I take a client-centered, practical approach
            tailored to your needs and goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            My work is grounded in evidence-based practices, and I draw from a
            range of therapeutic approaches depending on what feels most helpful
            for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            I integrate techniques from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT),
            Gestalt Therapy, Person-Centered Therapy, Solution-Focused Therapy,
            Insight-Oriented Therapy, and behavior modification strategies.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, this means our work is both reflective and practical —
            we’ll explore patterns, beliefs, and experiences, while also
            focusing on concrete tools you can use in everyday life.
